I recently started playing The Battle Cats (PONOS) and I got annoyed about having to keep checking how much materials I needed to collect to evolve a cat to its "true form" (TF). I'm making this app as a way to help me keep track of my fruits and determine how much I'll have to grind for each material :D

I'm currently inputting all data by hand so if anyone wants to help, I'll be forever grateful T-T

Unit data is taken from [Unit Description Project](https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/UDP) and [PackPack](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/779311078412255242) (Discord Bot). Additional information about cats can also be found at [MyGamatoto](https://mygamatoto.com/)

This is the main purpose of this project:

This is an extra project in the future:
